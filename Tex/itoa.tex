\nsection{Int to String}

\begin{exercise}
Write a function that converts an integer
to a string, using the skeleton code in the usual place online.
works correctly:

The integer may be signed (i.e.\ be positive or negative)
and you may assume it is in base-10.
Avoid using any of the built-in string-handling functions
to do this (e.g. \verb^snprintf()^)
including all those in \verb^string.h^.
